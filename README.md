The data for the analysis was gathered from three sources:
- Download from udacity classroom, that is the  **twitter_archive_enhanced.csv** file.
- Use of the requests library to download the **image-predictions.tsv** file.
- Use of the Tweepy library to query additional data via the Twitter API and store in **tweet_json.txt** file. <br>
The dataframes contain data about various dog ratings, their stages of growth names and more. The next steps included wrangling of the data, merging of the data frames and conveyance of insigths. Find detailed explanation on the wrangling and explanatory steps in the **wrangle_report.html** and **act_report.html**.
